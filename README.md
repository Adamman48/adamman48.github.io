Welcome to my main personal repo on GitHub!


The main purpose of this repository is to store my website, which 
you can find by [CLICKING HERE](https://adamman48.github.io/).

At this point in time you may find the website dull or short of 
content but bear with me, I am still learning to be a software 
developer. :)

I am a student of Green Fox Academy, based in Budapest, Hungary. 
My main learning focus is on JavaScript, alongside my wonderful 
mentors and 'Astral' team-mates in the 'Megalotis Cohort'.

I aim to update this site as I advance in my studies, so keep 
tuned in! ;)


You can find my other repos through the links below:

ever](https://github.com/Adamman48/hello-world)

repo](https://github.com/Adamman48/patchwork)

lesson](https://github.com/Adamman48/git-lesson-repository)



May the Force be with you!
